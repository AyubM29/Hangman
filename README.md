# Hangman

## Description
In this project, a player is prompted to guess letters of a randomly selected word from a predefined list. The main aim of this project was to develop python programming skills, more specifically emphasizing on object-oriented programming and user interaction. 

### What it does
The game prompts the user for letter inputs and displays the current status of the guessed word, replacing underscores with correctly guessed letters. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses the entire word or runs out of lives.
