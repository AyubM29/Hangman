# Hangman

## Description
In this project, a console-based version of the classic Hangman game was developed. It involves a player guessing letters for a word randomly chosen from a predefined list. The primary objective of this project was to enhance Python programming skills, with a focus on object-oriented programming and user interaction.

What it does:

The game prompts the user for letter inputs and displays the current status of the guessed word, replacing underscores with correctly guessed letters. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses the entire word or runs out of lives.

Aim of the project:

To create an engaging, interactive game which also highlights pythons capabilities in regards to logic and user interaction.

## Milestone 2: Create the variables for the game

In this step, the variable for the game were created and a random local package was imported. In addition to this a list of possible words to be guessed was also made. Next i created some functions to check input characters to ensure they were alphabetical and valid guesses.

## Milestone 3: Check if the guessed character is in the word

Next the inputs were checked in and then i proceeded to create functions to run the checks.

## Milestone 4: Create the game class

At this stage i introduced Object Oriented Programming concepts to develop the Hangman game. I also initialised the attributes.

## Milestone 5: Putting it all together

Finally at this point i coded the logic of the game.

## What i learnt

- Creating a class and initialising it
- Writing the functions
- Writing if statements
- Creating loops
- OOP
