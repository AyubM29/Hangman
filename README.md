# Hangman

## Description
In this project, a console-based version of the classic Hangman game was developed. It involves a player guessing letters for a word randomly chosen from a predefined list. The primary objective of this project was to enhance Python programming skills, with a focus on object-oriented programming and user interaction.

What it does:

The game prompts the user for letter inputs and displays the current status of the guessed word, replacing underscores with correctly guessed letters. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses the entire word or runs out of lives.

Aim of the project:

To create an engaging, interactive game which also highlights pythons capabilities in regards to logic and user interaction.

What i learned:

- Object-Orientated Programming in python
- Handling user input and validation
- String manipulation and control structures.
